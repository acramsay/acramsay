# Construction Notes

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
[Hugo Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder)
[Gallery Slider](https://github.com/gethugothemes/hugo-modules/gallery-slider)

Additionally, [Almeida CV](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/almeida-cv/) was used
as a hugo module but required significant changes to merge with the Coder theme.
Thus, the Aleida CV content was copied to this repo and modified accordingly.
