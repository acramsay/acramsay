An uncommon breed of software engineer and hobby farmer. I live in southern NH
with my wife, our son, and a small conglomerate of misfit dogs, horses, goats,
and chickens (when the bears allow it). This is Johan:

Professionally, I've spent the last {{% years-since 2011 %}} years as a systems
engineer, software developer, and DevOps enthusiast. I don't just write code; I
thrive on organizing intricate systems, engineering high-quality solutions, and
sharing my experience and passion with less seasoned team members. Most
recently, I've been contributing to open source by participating in the
[OpenTelemetry community](https://opentelemetry.io/community/) and offering
libre guidance on observability through [Open O11y](https://openo11y.dev).

When I step away from the screen, my interests span a spectrum of diverse
activities: tabletop games, sci-fi/fantasy novels, hiking, and smoking (as in
meat, fruit, and veggies). While I spend most of this time caring for my family,
home, and animals, I'll happily run off for most any water-related activity, be
it swimming, kayaking, or boating.
